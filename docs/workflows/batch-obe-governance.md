# Batch-Centric OBE Governance & Master Articulation Inheritance Workflow

This document details the multi-year Batch Cohort Lifecycle and Outcome-Based Education (OBE) Governance model designed to fulfill statutory accreditation standards (NBA Criteria 1, 2, and 3).

## 1. Overview & Policy Rationale

### 1.1 The Distinction: Batch vs. Academic Year vs. Regulation
In university accreditation governance, confusion often arises when tying Program Outcomes (POs) and Program Educational Objectives (PEOs) strictly to Academic Years or Curriculum Regulations:
- **Regulation (e.g., R20, R23)**: Defines course structure, contact hours, evaluation schemes (CIA/SEE weightages), and syllabus content. A regulation is typically revised every 3–4 years.
- **Academic Year (e.g., 2024-2025)**: Defines the institutional calendar during which classes run simultaneously across 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th years.
- **Batch (Cohort, e.g., 2024–2028)**: The cohort of students who enter together in an admission year and graduate after completing the degree duration (e.g., B.Tech 4 years, M.Tech 2 years, MCA 2 years).

### 1.2 Accreditation Rationale for Normalized Master Definitions & Cohort Inheritance
Institutional curriculum guidelines dictate:
1. **Master Definitions Stored Once**: Vision, Mission, PEOs, POs, and PSOs are defined at the Institution, Department, or Program level. They do not change arbitrarily each year and must not be redundantly stored per cohort.
2. **Cohort Inheritance**: When a student cohort is created (e.g. `2021-2025`, `2025-2029`), it **inherits** the active master Vision, Mission, PEOs, POs/PSOs, and articulation matrices matching its academic department and entry year.
3. **NBA / Curriculum Revisions**: If NBA or Academic Authorities redefine POs or PEOs in a given year (e.g., 2025), a new version is created in the master tables with `effective_from_year = 2025`. Prior batches retain their original standards, while newly admitted cohorts inherit the revised standards.
4. **Macro-Attainment Rollup**: Final program attainment can only be calculated once a batch completes its entire degree timeline (Semesters 1 through 8 for B.Tech). The batch-centric architecture allows seamless tracking of a cohort across all 4 years regardless of intervening calendar shifts.
