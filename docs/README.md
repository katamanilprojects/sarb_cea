- **[CO-PO Attainment & OBE Analysis](./workflows/co-po-attainment.md)**: Course Outcomes, Bloom's levels, question-to-CO mapping, direct/indirect NBA attainment matrices, and official dossier export via `OBEAnalysisPDFService`.
- **[Student Feedback & Institutional Surveys](./workflows/feedback-surveys.md)**: Course Outcomes indirect feedback, 5-domain Course End Surveys (CES), faculty appraisals, strict anonymity safeguards, and PDF/Excel exports.

### 4. [Roles & Permissions](./roles-and-permissions/)
- **[Master User, Feature, File & Database Table Mapping](./roles-and-permissions/user_feature_file_table_mapping.md)**: Exhaustive ground-truth mapping across all 6 roles, all 15 feature modules, 198 physical PHP controllers/views/services, and 66 read/write database tables.
- **[Role Permission Matrix](./roles-and-permissions/matrix.md)**: Cross-cutting feature and page access matrix across all six roles (`superadmin`, `admin`, `academic_section`, `hod`, `faculty`, `student`).
- **[Role Guides](./roles-and-permissions/role-guides.md)**: Comprehensive guide detailing responsibilities, script entrypoints, and underlying class methods for each role.

### 5. [Deployment & Operations](./deployment/)
- **[Installation & Configuration](./deployment/configuration.md)**: System prerequisites, `.env.php` setup in the parent directory, file permissions, and database initialization.

## 🏛️ System Overview

The system is built as a modular monolithic PHP application serving the administrative and academic needs of JNTUA College of Engineering Ananthapuramu (Autonomous).

### Core Characteristics:
- **Presentation Layer**: Procedural PHP page controllers that check `$_SESSION['role']` and render Bootstrap 4/5 user interfaces.
- **Service/Domain Layer**: Object-oriented PHP model classes (`*.class.php`) handling business logic, database queries, and input sanitization.
- **Data Access Layer**: `DBCredentials` singleton providing `mysqli` prepared statements with transactional safety.
- **Authentication**: Session-based with brute-force lockouts and on-the-fly upgrading of legacy MD5 hashes to BCrypt hashes.
